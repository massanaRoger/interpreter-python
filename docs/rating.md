# Self-Assessment for Custom Language Interpreter Project

## Project Title:
Custom Language Interpreter

## Team Members:
- Roger Massana
- Joel Teodoro

## Project Overview:
The Custom Language Interpreter project involved designing and implementing a simple, dynamically-typed programming language. The language supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, control structures, and print statements. The project includes an interpreter implemented in Python, providing both an interactive REPL and script execution functionality.

## Qualitative Assessment:

### Excellence in Design and Implementation:
- **Lexer and Parser:** The lexer and parser are robust and handle a variety of input cases effectively. The syntax rules are well-defined, ensuring accurate tokenization and parsing.
- **Interpreter:** The interpreter efficiently evaluates the AST, executing variable assignments, arithmetic operations, logical operations, print statements, and if-else conditions correctly.
- **REPL and Script Execution:** The REPL provides an interactive experience similar to Pythonâ€™s, while the script execution feature allows users to run code files seamlessly.

### Quality of the Solution:
- **Functionality:** The interpreter meets all the specified requirements, supporting arithmetic, logical operations, variable assignments, and control structures.
- **Usability:** The REPL and script execution functionalities make the tool user-friendly and accessible.
- **Documentation:** Clear and detailed documentation, including a comprehensive README.md, ensures users can easily understand and use the interpreter.

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Advanced Features:** Adding more advanced language features like loops, functions, and more complex data types could enhance the interpreter's capabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Improving error messages to provide more informative feedback to users would further enhance usability.

## Self-Assessment Score:
We believe our work merits a distinction rating of 8.5. The project demonstrates a high level of design and implementation quality, with effective team collaboration and a strong focus on functionality and usability. While there is room for further enhancements, the current state of the project meets and exceeds the basic requirements.

**Rating:** 8.5

## Conclusion:
The Custom Language Interpreter project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing us to apply theoretical concepts in a practical setting. The distinction rating of 8.5 reflects our commitment to delivering a high-quality solution while recognizing opportunities for further improvements.
